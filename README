This is the basic information about project SpiderWeb.

= Overview.
==============

SpiderWeb is a visualization tool for P2P Simulation. Apologies to others who may have used the same project name.
The simulation tools themselves (or pointers to them) will soon be added to this project repository.

At this point the project is a simple java application / applet that can be used to view simulation results as a "video"-like animation.
In the simulation view, the red circles represent peers, and the lines connecting them are network connections. 
The small rectangles are documents published by these peers (e.g. music files that they share). 
The nodes turn purple briefly when they output queries, or light pink when they respond to a query. In this case the document matching the query
also turns pink. The edges (network connections) appear "bold" when a query is propagated across the corresponding connections.
  
= Dependencies
===============

The project requires the following libraries:
+ Jung v.2.0.1 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jung/files/):
Specifically, SpiderWeb uses the JUNG packages provided in the jar files :
	jung-algorithms2.0.1.jar
	jung-api2.0.1.jar 
	jung-graph-impl2.0.1.jar
	jung-visualization2.0.1.jar

+ Apache Collections Generics (http://larvalabs.com/collections/) (preferably v.4.01)

= Using SpiderWeb
==================

Compile the source code with the libraries listed above, then run the main method in class P2PApplet.
You will be asked to load a processed log file.

Use the provided sample log file ProcessedLog.txt.

From there the rest should be clear.

= Ongoing development
======================

We are working on SpiderWeb to include more meaningful views. Possibly the graph of documents.
We are also hoping to have a "live" version, where we could view a real-time simulation.
